# Approach
## 4. Imputing Data
So for now, with missing Data, we remove them all from Training Set. For this approach, we instead use Imputation. Imputation ensures that missing values in a dataset are filled, enabling machine learning algorithms, which typically require complete data, to work effectively.
By addressing missing data through imputation, models can achieve better accuracy, reliability, and interpretability.
We will use KNNimputer to impute the missing values.

**We then train the model with imputed data**
